# spanish-flashcards
Python GUI program to help you learn the 1000 most frequently used words in Spanish! 

When you know the word, press the green checkmark. When you don't know the word, press the red x.
To flip to the back of the card, press the flip arrow. The next card is randomly generated for better
learning!

Any words that are marked as known will not circle through the flash cards. When you restart the application,
you start back up where you left off. If you want to add back the cards you marked as known, just delete the
contents of the progress.csv file.
